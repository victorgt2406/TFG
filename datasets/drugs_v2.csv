Krill Oil,https://www.drugs.com/krill-oil.html,"krill (euphausia superba) is a small crustacean with an appearance similar to shrimp. they are found in the colder waters of the ocean. krill primarily serve as a food source for other animals in the ocean, for example - whales, seals, penguins, squid and fish. krill is found in the oceans off of antarctica, canada, and japan. harvesting of krill is controversial. there is concern that commercial harvesting of krill for use in krill oil supplements could threaten the species that consume it for food, including whales. all krill oil sold in nutritional supplements is harvested out of the open ocean, upsetting the natural balance of food supplies for larger marine animals. commercial uses of krill include salmon aquaculture farming, harvesting for use in krill oil capsules, as food for home aquariums, and as a human food source. krill, known as okiami has been harvested by the japanese as a human food source since the 19th century, and is also consumed in south korea and taiwan. krill has a pink or red appearance due to the plankton that they consume as a food source in the ocean.1 what is in krill oil? krill contains an oil that is similar to the oils found in fish oils, the omega-3 fatty acids. omega-3 fatty acids are recommended for use in lowering triglyceride levels. krill oil use as a supplement to lower blood lipids is increasing in popularity.1 krill oil contains: the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids epa (eicosapentaenoic acid) and dha (docosahexaenoic). omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are also found in oils from certain types of fish, vegetables, and other plant sources. unlike fish oil, the omega-3 fatty acids in krill oil are absorbed and carried to the body's cells in phospholipid form. omega-3 fatty acids, in combination with diet and exercise, work by lowering the body's production of “bad”, low density lipoprotein (ldl) and triglycerides, and may raise high density lipoprotein (hdl) “good” cholesterol. high levels of cholesterol and triglycerides can lead to coronary artery disease, heart disease, and stroke. supportive, but not conclusive research shows that consumption of epa and dha omega-3 fatty acids may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease.  krill oil also contains: phospholipid-derived fatty acids (plfa), which may result in better absorption, and marine lethicin 2 a carotenoid antioxidant called astaxanthin. antioxidants inhibit oxidation and may neutralize the oxidant effect of free radicals and other substances in body tissues that may lead to disease. krill oil has also been used to treat high blood pressure, stroke, cancer, osteoarthritis, depression and premenstrual syndrome (pms), although high quality studies with adequately sized populations validating these uses are lacking. patients should speak with their physician prior to using krill oil for any condition. warnings issued by the fda note that certain fish (marlin, tuna, swordfish) may contain toxins such as methylmercury, leading some consumers to be wary of eating fish to obtain omega-3 fatty acids. manufacturers of krill oil suggest it may be safer due to lower levels of contaminants such as mercury. the fda has issued recommendations that women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant, and young children avoid eating more than 6 ounces of fish per week. however, krill may also contain methylmercury and other pollutants from sea water, although they are lower on the food chain and may contain lower values of such pollutants. one study noted that krill harvested from antarctica contains high levels of organic pesticides.3 manufacturers of krill oil claim one of the advantages of krill oil over fish oil is that it does not lead to the fishy aftertaste, reflux or belching of fish flavors, a common side effect with fish oil supplements. however, krill oil may still lead to these side effects in some patients. the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) has not specifically made recommendations on krill oil safety or effectiveness. krill oil is considered a dietary supplement and does not require a prescription.1,4,5,6,7,8 krill oil may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide."
