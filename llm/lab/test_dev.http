Major indices such as the S&P 500 and NASDAQ composite fell sharply in early trading, attributed to investor concerns over upcoming interest rate decisions by the Federal Reserve. High-growth tech companies, especially those in the semiconductor and software industries, saw significant sell-offs. Market analysts are closely monitoring the situation, with many expecting further fluctuations in response to any policy announcements or economic indicators released later in the week."
